Aggregate household consumption is computed as the sum of expenditure on food as well as value of auto consumption, expenditure on non-food, health items, education, housing utilities, value of in-kind wages, other benefits received by the household and a measure of the use value of durable goods owned by the household. Consumption per capita is then computed as the total consumption per adult equivalent.
